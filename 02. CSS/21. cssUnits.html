<h2>CSS Units</h2>

<p>There are two types of units you can use in CSS, relative and absolute units. The size of a relative unit, with the exception of percentages, is related to the viewport or font size of an element. An absolute unit will always be the same, regardless of the viewport or font size.</p>
